## Description 
```
I built an application that gives users a fast and easy way to track their money. This app allows the user access to their information at any time, which is important to users when offline. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total will be updated when they're brought back online.
